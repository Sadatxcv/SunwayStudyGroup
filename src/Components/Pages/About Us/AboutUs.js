      <h1 className="orangeheader">Message From Chairman</h1>
      <p className="detailsPara">
        Hinging upon a modernism-prone synthesis of concept of digitalization
        and concept of multi-cultural diversity Global has long been nurturing
        its vision of transforming the human beings into resources and
        mobilizing those human resources towards the development of Bangladesh
        keeping pace with the new liberal market of economy. So, from the very
        inception (1998) Global started its visionary journey focusing on two
        enlightened approaches—developing human resources through IT and making
        them able to get accustomed to the new foreign environments through
        languages. With a view to accommodating those languages and IT trainings
        to the increasing demands of the learners of different classes Global
        has so far been able to set up such a platform as to transform tactless
        and unskilled human resources into the smartest ones having the
        capabilities of coping with any new challenging environment.
        <br /><br />
        So, I do expect always a helping hand to be extended by our enlightened
        well-wishers from every corner of the world in implementing our noble
        goal set on the developing principles of globalization.
